# Control Manual 📘 ![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-work--in--progress-yellow)

This repository is a personal collection of notes and study material related to various control theory concepts. Each folder here represents a distinct area of control systems I’ve explored, ranging from fundamental theories to modern and industrial applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **`Basic_control_manual/`**  
  Covers classical control theory: introduction to control systems, time/frequency response, root locus, Bode plots, Nyquist theory, and related concepts.

- **`Modern_control_manual/`**  
  Focuses on modern state-space methods, controllability/observability, pole placement, LQR, and nonlinear system concepts.

- **`MPC_control_manual/`**  
  Contains notes and materials on Model Predictive Control, including a case study on a lane-changing car modeled using the bicycle model.

- **`Industrial_control_manual/`**  
  Includes notes on industrial control topics taught in academic courses, such as PID tuning, PLCs, SCADA, and real-world system modeling.

## 🗂 Folder Contents

Each topic folder will contain:
- 📘 **Literary file** – Detailed PDF notes
- 🧩 **Support files** – Diagrams, code snippets, or example illustrations *(optional)*
- 📝 **Problems file** – Exercises and practice problems *(to be added later)*
